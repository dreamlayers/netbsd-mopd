This is a port of Mats O Jansson's mopd to linux, special thanx to David 
Hornsby from the University of Melbourne for the use of pf.c from the 
arns package.

I have booted test images on my Vaxstation 3100 from my PC running Linux 
2.0.20 with an AE-2 NE2000 compatable card. There are bound to be bugs, 
especially with dealing with different network cards etc. Please report 
any bugs you find in this linux version to me and I will do the best I 
can to fix them. 

To compile mopd, simply go into the directory and type 'make'. The man 
files have also been included from the BSD version of mopd.

Enjoy
