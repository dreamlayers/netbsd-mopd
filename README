mopd-linux-20000808

 This is the Linux version of Mats Jansens' Mopd.
 
 The sources here are taken from the NetBSD version of mopd 2.5.3/4 
 in CVS, plus some bits from the OpenBSD port, and the security 
 fixes reported on BUGTRAQ on 08 Aug 2000. 
 
 I had to rewrite the Makefiles, and hack things about a bit to compile 
 under Linux, So if this version doesnt work for you, send email to the 
 Linux/VAX list detailing the problem. 
 
 The mopa.out program does not work. The a.out structures have different
 names under NetBSD and Linux (see /usr/include/a.out.h), and so the 
 code needs re-writing.
